document = """Introducing Le Potato: A Simple, Elegant LLM Chat UI
Le Potato is a simple, elegant LLM Chat user interface that allows you to interact with your favorite model in a unique and easy-to-use UI. Our goal is to provide a minimalist interface that lets you focus on the conversation, not the UI.

What is Le Potato?
Le Potato is made with contributions in mind, so you can easily modify, add, or remove features to suit your needs. We've designed it to be simple and easy to understand, so you can start using it right away.

Features
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): This feature allows you to retrieve relevant content from a file you upload to your model based on a query. This content is then added to your query to help your model generate a better response.
Web Search (coming soon or never): This feature will enable your AI to work with more recent information and generate even better responses. The code is already available on our GitHub repository, but it's not yet integrated into the UI.
Details
Le Potato is built using:

Python with Flask as the backend
HTML, CSS, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend
Get Involved
Le Potato is open-source and available on GitHub. You can find the repository here. We encourage you to star the repository, open an issue, or contribute to the project. Your feedback and suggestions are welcome!
